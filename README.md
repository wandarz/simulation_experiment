# Interactive Planetary Simulation

An interactive web-based simulation of two-body gravitational interaction with real-time visualization and data analysis features.

## Overview

This project simulates the gravitational interaction between two celestial bodies (represented as blue and yellow planets) in a 2D space. The simulation provides real-time visualization of the orbital mechanics and includes various interactive controls to modify the simulation parameters.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**
  - Adjust masses of both bodies
  - Set initial velocities and directions using intuitive compass controls
  - Modify simulation time
  - Zoom in/out functionality for better visualization

- **Real-time Visualization**
  - Live animation of planetary motion
  - Trailing paths showing orbital trajectories
  - Scale indicator for distance reference
  - Dynamic planet sizes based on mass

- **Data Analysis**
  - Real-time distance graph between bodies
  - Velocity component graphs (vx and vy) for both bodies
  - Interactive Plotly graphs with dark theme
  - Time-based data tracking

## Technical Details

- Built with HTML5 Canvas for visualization
- Uses Plotly.js for data visualization
- Implements gravitational force calculations
- Real-time data processing and visualization
- Responsive and interactive UI elements

## Usage

1. Adjust the masses of both bodies using the sliders
2. Set initial velocities and directions using the compass controls
3. Modify the simulation time as needed
4. Use the zoom controls to adjust the view
5. Observe the real-time graphs for distance and velocity analysis

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection (for loading Plotly.js)

## Note

The simulation uses a simplified two-body gravitational model and assumes:
- Perfect circular orbits
- No external forces
- Point masses for gravitational calculations
- 2D space representation
